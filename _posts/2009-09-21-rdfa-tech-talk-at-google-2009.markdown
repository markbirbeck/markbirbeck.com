Although my talk _Beyond Web 2.0 -- How RDFa Can Help to Democratise Data on
the Web_, took place back in June, it's only just now been made available
online, due to technical problems.

<!-- more -->

  
(I should say too, that those same technical problems also mean that the video
is in 50's style black and white; maybe it gives it a bit more authority.)

  
I really enjoyed the session, and you'll hear at one point near the end I get
to put some questions to Othar Hansson and Kavi Goel, and the rest of the Rich
Snippets team, about how they'll be using RDFa going forwards.

  
Many thanks to T. V. Raman for having me back, and of course, for the Google
lunch.
