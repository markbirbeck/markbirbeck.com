The [XHTML Modularization 1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-modularization/)
document is a W3C Working Draft, which provides a set of modules that
represent the entire XHTML language, but which can be combined and reused to
create new languages. It's also possible to build languages that use only a
subset of the modules, such as when creating a profile of XHTML for mobile
devices.

From the abstract:

> This document is version 1.1 of XHTML Modularization, an abstract
modularization of XHTML and implementations of the abstraction using XML
Document Type Definitions (DTDs), and XML Schemas. This modularization
provides a means for subsetting and extending XHTML, a feature needed for
extending XHTML's reach onto emerging platforms. This specification is
intended for use by language designers as they construct new XHTML Family
Markup Languages. This specification does not define the semantics of elements
and attributes, only how those elements and attributes are assembled into
modules, and from those modules into markup languages. This second version of
this specification includes several minor updates to provide clarifications
and address errors found in the first version. It also provides an
implementation using XML Schemas.
