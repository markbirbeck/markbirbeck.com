For me, one of the most exciting developments on the web in recent years has
been the growth in services that let you manage raw data. Many of the most
useful such services originate when some web-based application--such as Google
calendars or spreadsheets--exposes the underlying data. For example, with
Google Spreadsheets, it's possible to use ATOM to query spreadsheets for
certain values, or add rows and columns, making this a very powerful way of
storing data 'in the cloud'. (See [Web 2.0, Copernicus and Spartacus: Moving
the centre of the web](http://internet-apps.blogspot.com/2006/01/web-20
-copernicus-and-spartacus-moving.html).)

We're building quite a few XForms applications that make full use of this
power, and it's something I'll be talking about at XTech 2007, in my session
[XForms, REST, XQuery...and
skimming](http://2007.xtech.org/public/schedule/detail/114). Since the
approach we use could work on any XForms processor, talking to any ATOM-based
server, we've decided to create an open source project to host the forms, and
document their use. If this is an area of interest to you, check out the
[GData XForms client project on Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/gdata-
xforms-client/), and its [discussion forum](http://groups.google.com/group
/gdata-xforms-client).
