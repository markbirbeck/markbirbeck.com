[[Google Calendar](http://www.google.com/calendar) is a good example of an
application that benefits from features of the Sidewinder Viewer, without the
need for any changes to be made. Given particular calendars that you may have
cause to refer to throughout your day, it is a simple task to invoke the
viewer in such a way as to make your calendars readily available, yet also
unobtrusive.

For instance, you may want to keep a small calendar always visible on your
desktop, but use transparency settings in order to minimise its impact on
other applications:

Alternatively, there might be calendars of specific events that are of
interest to you, such as sports fixtures. By docking the calendar to an edge
of the screen and setting it to automatically slide on to and off from the
display, such a calendar can always be instantly available without cluttering
your desktop:
