The [XML Events 2](http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2007/ED-xml-events-20071114/)
document is a W3C Editors' Note, authored by Shane McCarron of Applied Testing
and Technology, Inc., and [Mark Birbeck](/mark-birbeck). It provides a way to
specify event listeners and handlers for a document, using XML mark-up.

From the abstract:

> The XML Events module defined in this specification provides XML languages
with the ability to uniformly integrate event listeners and associated event
handlers with Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 event interfaces. The result
is to provide an interoperable way of associating behaviors with document-
level markup.
