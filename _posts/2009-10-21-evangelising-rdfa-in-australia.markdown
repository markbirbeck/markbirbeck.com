I was recently lucky enough to take my first trip to Australia. I was there to
do two talks, the first on RDFa and its use in Government (given in Canberra,
the home of the Australian government), and the second, a talk on RDFa and its
impact on the web (given at the Web Directions South 2009 conference).

I've embedded the presentations below, although it's probably better to view
the presentations at SlideShare, so that you can see the speaker notes:
