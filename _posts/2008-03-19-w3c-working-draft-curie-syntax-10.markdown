The [CURIE Syntax 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/curie/) document is a W3C Working
Draft, authored by Shane McCarron of Applied Testing and Technology, Inc., and
[Mark Birbeck](/mark-birbeck). It provides a way to express URIs in a compact
way that is independent of the language in which the compact URI (CURIE) is
being used.

From the abstract:

> The aim of this document is to outline a syntax for expressing URIs in a
generic, abbreviated syntax. While it has been produced in conjunction with
the HTML Working Group, it is not specifically targeted at use by XHTML Family
Markup Languages. Note that the target audience for this document is Language
designers, not the users of those Languages.
