I was lucky enough to be interviewed by Paul Miller for his weekly podcast
yesterday. We spoke about RDFa, touching on a range of topics from its goals
and how it came about, to its relationship to linked data and how it's being
used in some recent projects for UK Government web-sites.

The podcast is on Paul's [Cloud of Data](http://cloudofdata.com/2009/07
/talking-with-mark-birbeck-about-rdfa-and-its-use-in-government/) site.

  
And there's more information about the projects, in [More RDFa goodness from
UK government web-sites](/mark-birbeck/blog/2009/04/23/more-rdfa-goodness-
