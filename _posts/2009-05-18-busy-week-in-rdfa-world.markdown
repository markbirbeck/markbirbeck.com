This last week has been great for the profile of RDFa, and this post is a
mixture of my own experiences and some broader news during that time.

## Yahoo!'s Open Hack

The week began for me with a presentation at [Yahoo!'s Open Hack 2009](http://openhacklondon.pbworks.com/)
in London, on [RDFa: Now everyone can have an API](http://openhacklondon.pbworks.com/RDFa)
(I changed
the title at the last minute). The Tech Talk part of the Hack Day was packed
with useful information on some of Yahoo!'s latest technologies, from YQL to
SearchMonkey, through Blueprint to BOSS. So for me it was great to see RDFa up
there alongside those technologies as something that developers should be
finding out more about.

## 'RDFa in Drupal' Code Sprint

I had originally
planned to stay for the entire 24 hours of the Hack Day, but having recently
discovered that [Stephane Corlosquet](http://www.deri.ie/about/team/member/stephane_corlosquet/) was
planning a [Drupal code sprint to add support for RDFa to Drupal core](http://drupal.org/node/443824),
I knew I just had to go to [DERI, Galway](http://www.deri.ie/) and offer some help. We use Drupal a lot for our
work, and if nothing else, this was a chance to give something back. But more
than that, I'm really excited about [the direction Drupal is taking in terms of the semantic web](http://buytaert.net/drupal-the-semantic-web-and-search);
having a widely used and popular open source web platform that is using RDFa
is of course great news for RDFa, but more importantly, it's great news for
the semantic web. The code sprint itself was very impressive. I couldn't stay
for the whole four days, but everyone was very professional, and working with
the team that had joined Stephane gave me a clear illustration of how it is
that Drupal is able to continue to evolve and gain popularity.

## Google's Rich Snippets

After a quick stopover in Dublin with the family of my friend and colleague
Bartek, combined with a great meeting with him and his team at [Geco Loco](http://gecoloco.com/),
I arrived back in London. I was home for less
than 12 hours before I heard of [Google's announcement that they would begin to index RDFa](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/05/introducing-rich-snippets.html), and then spent half the night watching the Twitterverse
take in the implications of this event. I'll be writing up my own views on
this in the next few days (I've been tied up finishing an RDFa tutorial for
another web-site), but for now I want to say that Google's announcement is,
_without reservation_, incredible news for both RDFa and the semantic web.

## A Virtuous Circle

What a week; a major consumer of web-pages announces that they will be
processing more and more RDFa, at the same time as a key open source web
platform makes it easier for publishers to create RDFa. We now have the
virtuous circle that will see the pace of RDFa adoption accelerate
dramatically.

## Postscript: Talks on RDFa at SemTech

I thoroughly enjoyed my time at SemTech last year, delivering an introductory
tutorial on RDF and RDFS (the [slides are on SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/mark.birbeck/a-first-course-in-rdf-and-rdfs-resource-description-framework-and-resource-description-framework-schema)).
But I think I'm going to enjoy it even more this year, since my
sessions this time around are on RDFa. The first session is [RDFa: The semantic web's missing link](http://www.semantic-conference.com/session/2077/),
and was originally intended to explain to
people why using RDFa would help to speed up the adoption of the semantic web.
Given recent events I'll probably do less of the evangelising, and use it as
an opportunity to present some newer ideas. The second session is an [SEO panel](http://www.semantic-conference.com/session/2049/),
and I don't think
the organisers will mind me saying that including RDFa in the discussion was
an afterthought. But once again, in the light of Google's announcement, I'm
hoping that there will be a lot of interest in the session, as we look at
where RDFa fits in to the broader search landscape.
