The [XHTML Access Attribute](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-access/) is a W3C
Working Draft, which provides a single element to be used in documents, to
enable generic document accessibility.

The document is the work of the W3C's XHTML Working Group, and the editors
are:

  

  * [Mark Birbeck](/mark-birbeck), webBackplane
  

  * Shane McCarron, Applied Testing and Technology, Inc.
  

  * Steven Pemberton, CWI
  

  * T. V. Raman, Google, Inc.

From the abstract:

> The XHTML Access module defines an element that, when used in conjunction
with other XHTML modules in XHTML Family Markup Languages, enables a more
robust accessibility model than is presently possible.
