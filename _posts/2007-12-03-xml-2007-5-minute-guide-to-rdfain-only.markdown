Presentation abstract: RDFa is a generic way to add metadata to mark-up, and
has been described by Bob du Charme as "microformats done right". This talk
aims to get you up to speed on this new W3C standard -- fast. By: [Mark
Birbeck](/profile/mark-birbeck) Conference: XML2007 held at Marriott Copley
Place, Boston, Massachusetts, USA, from December 3rd to 5th, 2007. Session:
[Lightning Rounds for XML
Standards](http://2007.xmlconference.org/public/content/lightning-rounds), on
Tuesday December 4th, 2007. Session abstract: Lightning rounds are a series of
short, fast-paced presentations on related topics. The rules are simple: Each
presentation is allowed exactly 20 slides. Each slide is displayed for exactly
20 seconds. We change the slides. As a result, each presentation lasts for
exactly six minutes and forty seconds. Applause and (polite) heckling are
encouraged, and the evening will be energetic, informative, and fun. The
audience is welcome to come and go throughout the evening.
