From the abstract:

> The modern Web is made up of an enormous number of documents that have been
created using HTML. These documents contain significant amounts of structured
data, which is largely unavailable to tools and applications. When publishers
can express this data more completely, and when tools can read it, a new world
of user functionality becomes available, letting users transfer structured
data between applications and web sites, and allowing browsing applications to
improve the user experience: an event on a web page can be directly imported
into a user's desktop calendar; a license on a document can be detected so
that users can be informed of their rights automatically; a photo's creator,
camera setting information, resolution, location and topic can be published as
easily as the original photo itself, enabling structured search and sharing.
