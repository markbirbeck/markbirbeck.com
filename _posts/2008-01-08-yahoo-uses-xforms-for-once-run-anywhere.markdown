[Yahoo! recently announced their entry into the mobile web applications space]
(http://yhoo.client.shareholder.com/press/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=284835),
with a service that allows applications to be built and hosted using
[Blueprint, a purpose-built mark-up
language](http://us.beta.mobile.yahoo.com/developers) based on XForms.

<!-- more -->

  
The [Blueprint roadmap](http://us.beta.mobile.yahoo.com/developers/roadmap)
describes the underlying philosophy:

  

> Much of Blueprint's philosophy and syntax comes from XForms. We opted for a
full declarative language because it was the only way we could effectively run
on the wide range of devices out there, some of which have no scripting at
all. By using declarative syntax, we can encapsulate and hide the scripting
specifics. In some cases, the code could run on the phone, in other case, such
as XHTML, we can put the logic on our servers. It's the perfect way to deal
with the various environments and their capabilities.

  
  
At the moment Blueprint is simply converted to XHTML plus JavaScript for
delivery to devices, but the mention of XForms gives a clear indication of
where they are heading. And given that Google did something similar with the
launch of its [Google Mashup Language](http://code.google.com/gme/index.html),
it all bodes well for a new wave of web applications that won't be built using
JavaScript (or even Java and GWT) but will use straightforward, device-
independent, mark-up.

  
Write once, run anywhere, anybody?
