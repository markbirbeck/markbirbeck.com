Conference: WWW2007: The 16th International World Wide Web Conference, held at
the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel in Banff, Alberta, Canada, from May 8th to

Session: [Industry Panel: Reinventing the Mobile Browsing Experience Through
Ajax](http://www2007.org/industrytopic2.php), on Thursday May 10, 2007.

  
Abstract: Ajax development has become a key plank of the Mobile 2.0 movement
on the desktop. Now this technology is making inroads into the mobile browser.
Many mobile browser vendors and others are making strides in this area. This
panel will explore the peculiarities of Ajax on the mobile platform. What kind
of user experiences can Ajax enable on the mobile that help to differentiate a
vanilla mobile browsing experience? What tools do developers have available to
them to work with today to get started in this space? What are handset vendors
and browser vendors doing in this arena? What differentiates Ajax development
on the mobile from PC Ajax development? What are the challenges?
