From the abstract:

> The XHTML Role Attribute defined in this specification allows the author to
annotate XML Languages with machine-extractable semantic information about the
purpose of an element. Use cases include accessibility, device adaptation,
server-side processing, and complex data description. This attribute can be
integrated into any markup language based upon XHTML Modularization.
