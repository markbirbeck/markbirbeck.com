I'm really looking forward to my first ever visit to Australia, starting
Sunday. Whilst it would have been fun to do the trip with the family, it's a
close second that I've been invited there by W3C Australia, to speak about
RDFa.

I'll be doing a few informal workshops, and a couple of public talks, as well
as taking in [Australian Web Week](http://webweek.com.au/).

  
The first public talk is on Wednesday, at the Australian National University
in Canberra, on [RDFa and its use in
government](http://www.w3c.org.au/newsandevents/index.php/2009/09/29/seminar-
rdfa-and-its-use-in-government-mark-birbeck-uk-7-october-2009). Whilst I'll be
using some of the [UK government projects](/mark-birbeck/blog/2009/04/23/more-
rdfa-goodness-from-uk-government-web-sites) I've worked on to illustrate my
points, it will also be interesting to hear what attendees have to say about
the recently launched [data.australia.gov.au](http://data.australia.gov.au/).

  
Later in the week I'll be at the Web Directions South conference in Sydney,
where I'll be talking about [Marking up content with
RDFa](http://south09.webdirections.org/program/w3ctrack#marking-up-content-
with-rdfa), in the W3C track.

  
And to round the whole thing off I'll get the chance to finally meet in
person, some of the people who I've been reading over the years, such as David
Peterson, Laurent Lefort and John Allsopp.

  
All in all, it looks like it will be a busy and exciting week.
