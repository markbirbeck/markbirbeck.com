We're pleased to be launching two new initiatives to help people who are
interested in XForms.

<!-- more -->

  
The first is the all new XForms Developer Zone web-site -- or
[xformsdz](http://xformsdz.org), as we're calling it.

  
Whilst the Developer Zone will be unashamedly biased towards XForms, within
that, we'll have discussions, articles, code snippets, and tutorials about any
XForms processor we can find, and any application framework in which it's
used.

  
To accompany the web-site, we're also launching a regular newsletter, and a
London XForms User Group.

  

## The London XForms User Group

  
  
The [inaugural meeting](http://www.meetup.com/london-xforms-user-
group/calendar/11102461/) of the user group will be in Clerkenwell, London,
hosted by Skills Matter. We'll be looking at the architecture of XForms, in
particular what it means to have MVC support built in from the ground up, and
we'll be using [XForms and Google Maps](http://xformsdz.org/article/2009/09
/easy-map-controls-ubiquity-xforms) as a case-study.

  
The October meeting will look at the [benefits of using XForms for the UK
insurance industry](http://www.meetup.com/london-xforms-user-
group/calendar/10787076/), and we're lucky enough to have an industry expert
-- Neal Champion -- speaking to us that evening.

  
If you'd like to come along, we'd love to see you. And even if you can't make
it, [join the user group mailing-list](http://www.meetup.com/london-xforms-
user-group/), and we'll keep you posted about XForms-related activities and
events, in and around London.
