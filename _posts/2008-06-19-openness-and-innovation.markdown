Abstract: The idea of openness has captured people's imagination. The openness
of the Internet has enabled entrepreneurs to innovate without seeking
permission. Open source software development models have facilitated the
creation of reliable and responsive software platforms, and even created new
platforms such as the Web. Open standards, application programming interfaces
(API), and open data have enabled the creation or new and bespoke products and
services. The adaptive approach to design has allowed users to become the
final designers of their tools. Indeed, even in business the idea of corporate
open innovation is taking hold. We will examine these phenomena, consider what
is distinctive about openness, ask 'Why now?', and consider the future
potential of innovation based on openness.
