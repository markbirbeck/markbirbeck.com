    <p>There is still plenty of scope for the browser to evolve, but the truth is
that <em>progressive browser enhancement</em> makes browser evolution far less
significant than it has been until now. That’s probably not a bad thing, given
the chaos that is currently surrounding the development of HTML at the W3C.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="http://hesketh.com/publications/progressive_enhancem
ent_paving_way_for_future.html">Progressive enhancement</a> is an approach to web development that has
been around for a few years now. (More on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement">PE at
Wikipedia</a>.) At its most
basic it suggests building our web pages in a ‘clean’ and uncluttered way, and
then layering functionality onto the mark-up using various mechanisms, such as
stylesheets and scripts. The idea is that browsers without the additional
capabilities can still render the page in some fashion, but those with
additional power–such as scripting support–can add more enhanced features.</p>

<p>This principle actually underpins much of the work we’ve been doing on XHTML
2, which has involved taking HTML back to its semantic roots. In particular
the work on RDFa has been to a large extent motivated by providing more
semantic ‘hooks’ on which to attach increasingly focused functionality. (The
work pre-dates the term <em>progressive enhancement</em>, so it isn’t generally
called that in our discussions of XHTML 2 or RDFa.)</p>

<p>But there is a new phenomena afoot, which I’d like to call <em>progressive
browser enhancement</em>. It’s something we’ve been doing for a while with our
work on XForms and formsPlayer, but it also has wider applicability.</p>

<h2 id="dom-events-and-standards">DOM Events and standards</h2>

<p>To illustrate the idea of PBE, let’s look at eventing in the browser. Many
Ajax libraries have their own eventing architecture, and they are without
exception non-standard. This is a shame, since the W3C has a standard for DOM
events (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/">DOM 2 Events</a>) which has
been around for years and is very clearly defined. Of course, part of the
problem is that whilst it has been implemented in Firefox, Safari and Opera,
it’s not available in Internet Explorer. This meant that when we began our
work on <a href="http://www.formsPlayer.com/">formsPlayer, our XForms processor plug-in for Internet
Explorer</a>, we had to implement a DOM 2 Events
component ourselves.</p>

<p>This does however mean that DOM 2 Events support is potentially available for
all browsers, but of course the problem now is that in order to make use of it
on IE, people would have to install formsPlayer. And even if we made the
module available separately (which we will be doing shortly), the problem for
the programmer is that they can’t assume that it is installed; there is still
an annoying rift between those who have browsers with DOM 2 Events support,
and those that don’t.</p>

<h2 id="using-javascript-to-enhance-the-browser">Using JavaScript to enhance the browser</h2>

<p>To fill the gap we simply implemented a DOM 2 Events library in JavaScript.
Whilst most Ajax libraries went the route of creating their own non-standard
eventing architectures, we went the other way and implemented the standard.
The advantage of our approach is that if our end-user is running a browser
with reasonable standards support such as Firefox, Opera or Safari, they’ll
get native support for DOM 2 Events, and hopefully a faster experience.
Similarly, if our user is on IE and has installed the formsPlayer DOM 2 Events
component, they will likewise get a faster experience. It’s only the middle
group using the scripted version of DOM 2 Events who will have a slightly
slower experience.</p>

<p>But the key point is that the end-user now has some control, since they can
add a DOM 2 Event component if they want to–most likely as part of some other
package–independent of the actual web applications they are using. And for
the <em>authors</em> of web applications life is much easier, since they are coding
to a standard, rather than being forced to code to the specific <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/event/">event
architecture of YUI</a>,
<a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/node/134">Dojo</a>, or whatever Ajax library they want to
use.</p>

<p>This is the key idea of <em>progressive browser enhancement</em>.</p>

<h2 id="threading-in-google-gears">Threading in Google Gears</h2>

<p>Another example of PBE is <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gears/api_workerpool.html">threading in Google
Gears</a>. There are a
number of JavaScript libraries around that create simple threading by using
the timer in JavaScript. This is fine for a lot of uses but can affect
performance. However, we can follow the same approach as I described above for
DOM 2 Events; if the function calls that the programmer makes to create a
thread are ‘standard’, then although in normal operation the less-efficient
JavaScript version would be used, with no change to the code the web
application can take advantage of ‘proper’ threading, should a user have
Google Gears installed. (See also: <a href="http://internet-apps.blogspot.com/2006/09/ajax-makes-
browser-choice-irrelevantbut.html">Ajax makes browser choice irrelevant…but
we still need standards</a>.)</p>

<p>Of course, most users are unlikely to be looking for a threading library to
install, just as they will not be downloading a DOM 2 Events module. But if
these components are small enough to be bundled up with other pieces of
software they will gradually find their way onto users machines as part of
other, useful, packages.</p>

<p>In whatever way the distribution takes place, it’s the <em>end-users</em> of our web
applications that are in control of progressively enhancing their browser, not
the web application programmers themselves.</p>

<p>These principles have underpinned the design of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/yowl/">Yowl, a centralised
notification system for web applications</a>.</p>

<h2 id="yowl-centralised-notification-system">Yowl centralised notification system</h2>

<p>Yowl is a way of providing notifications to users of web applications, but in
a way that the user themselves can control. It was inspired by
<a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a>, which runs on the Mac, and which is used by
applications such as Skype and Adium; by passing all notifications through a
central system users are given the power to decide which messages they are
interested in, and how they want to see–or even hear–them.</p>

<p><em>Progressive browser enhancement</em> allows Yowl notifications to make use of
advanced features in the browser if they are available, but to fall back to
basic notifications if not. For example, we’ve created <a href="http://code.google.com/p/yowl/wiki/DisplayStyleSystray">a Windows component
that allows messages to be displayed above the system
tray</a>. The component
is invoked and called from script, and works with both Firefox and Internet
Explorer:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/phot
os/mark-birbeck/662221052/"><img src="http://farm
2.static.flickr.com/1269/662221052_91a2a6e07e.jpg" alt="Yowl notifications in IE with Sidewinder system tray component" /></a></p>

<p>However, if the systray component is not installed, the Yowl notification
system will simply use JavaScript to show messages within the browser window.
You can see a sample of the non-enhanced notifications
<a href="http://yowl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/test/test-yowl.html">here</a>–it will run
in all the major browsers:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mark-
birbeck/662082230/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1255/
662082230_8ea01731f8.jpg" alt="Yowl notifications running in Firefox" /></a></p>

<p>The programmer need change nothing in their code to make use of the systray
component if it is present, since as with the DOM 2 Events example, or Google
Gears and threading, the <em>user</em> is in control of the browser enhancement, not
the programmer.</p>

<p>(For more on Yowl see the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/yowl/">Yowl open source project
page</a>, <a href="/2007/06/yowl-design-principles-and-how-to-use.html">Yowl: Design principles and how to use
it</a> and <a href="/2007/06/yowl-open-source-
centralised.html">Yowl: An open
source centralised notification system</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="where-does-this-leave-the-browser">Where does this leave the browser?</h2>

<p>There is still plenty of scope for the browser to evolve and make available
the kind of features we’re talking about here. But the truth is that
<em>progressive browser enhancement</em> makes browser evolution far less significant
than it has been until now. That’s probably not a bad thing, given the chaos
that is currently surrounding the development of HTML since the W3C gave its
support to <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/">HTML 5</a>; the
spec itself is becoming increasingly top-heavy, and bears little relationship
to the early principles of HTML. Far from relying on enormous ‘kitchen-sink’
specifications, PBE looks to add new features in a more nimble way, via small
and focused modules.</p>
